     <br> <h2> <left> <u> <font color="green"> What is Water Pollution? </font></left></h2> </u>
   <font size="4"> <Left> Water Pollution is the contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human activities. Water bodies include for example lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers and groundwater. 
    Water pollution results when contaminants are introduced into the natural environment. For example, releasing inadequately treated wastewater into natural water bodies can lead 
    to degradation of aquatic ecosystems. In turn, this can lead to public health problems for people living downstream. They may use the same polluted river water for drinking or 
    bathing or irrigation. Water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and disease, e.g. due to water-borne diseases. The causes of water pollution include a wide range 
    of chemicals and pathogens as well as physical parameters. Contaminants may include organic and inorganic substances. All plants and organisms living in or being exposed to polluted 
    water bodies can be impacted. The effects can damage individual species and impact the natural biological communities they are part of. </Left></font>  

<br> <h2> <left> <u> <font color="green"> Causes Of Water Pollution</font></u></left></h2> <font size="4"> <li>Nutrient pollution is caused by wastewater, sewage, and fertilizers. The high levels of nutrients in these sources end up in bodies of water and promote algae and weed growth, which can make the water undrinkable and depleted oxygen causing aquatic organisms to die.</li>
<li>Pesticides and herbicides applied to crops and residential areas concentrate in the soil and are carried to the groundwater by rainwater and runoff. For these reasons anytime someone drills a well for water it must be checked for pollutants.</li>
<li>Industrial waste is one of the main causes of water pollution, by creating primary and secondary pollutants including sulphur, lead and mercury, nitrates and phosphates, and oil spills.</li>
<li>In developing countries around 70% of their solid waste is dumped directly into the ocean or sea. This causes serious problems including the harming and killing of sea creatures, which ultimately affects humans.</li>
</ul></font>
<br> <h2> <left> <u> <font color="green"> Conservation of Water Pollution </font></u> </left></h2>
    
<font size="4"> <li>Availability of water for future generations should be ensured, and the rate of consumption of water in the ecosystem should not exceed its replacement rate.</li><li>Energy conservation: In some water management plants, most of the electricity is used in water pumping, delivery, and wastewater treatment. This consumption of energy must be minimised.</li><li> Conservation of Habitat: Reducing personal use of water can help to preserve water for local wildlife and aquatic habitats. On the other hand, the construction of water diversion infrastructures such as dams should be reduced to some extent as it may disturb the local flora and fauna. </li> </font>
