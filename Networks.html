   <body leftmargin="60px" rightmargin="60px"> When you buy a new computer, the first thing you’ll probably try to do is connect to the Internet. To do this, you establish a connection to your router, which receives the data from the Internet and then forwards it to the computer.

    Of course that’s not all: Next, you could also connect your printer, smartphone or TV to the router so that these devices are also connected to the Internet. Now you have connected different devices to each other via a central access point and created your own network.
